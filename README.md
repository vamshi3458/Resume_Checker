*Data Analytics Project*

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning techniques can be applied to automate the resume screening process. By analyzing candidate resumes, extracting relevant features, and building predictive models, the project aims to assist HR teams in identifying qualified candidates efficiently.

---

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on resume data to uncover patterns and insights.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key skills and qualifications.
- Develop machine learning models to classify resumes as suitable or unsuitable for a given job.
- Provide actionable insights to improve recruitment decision-making.
